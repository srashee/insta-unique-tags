# insta-unique-tags

Apparently instagram finds using the same hashtags to be abuse and you don't
actually get added to the hashtags list if you do this. I don't want to come
up with new hashtags everytime I post so I will have python generate me a list
of N unique hashtags from a list and have them e-mailed to me
